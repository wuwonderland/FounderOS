# FOUNDER OS — agent rules

Full project docs live in **CLAUDE.md** (same directory) — read it first.
This file exists so non-Claude agents (Codex, etc.) get the same house rules.

## Non-negotiables

- **Never commit or copy secrets.** Credentials live in `.env.local`
  (gitignored) and Alex's canonical files; `lib/creds.ts` resolves them.
  Never copy keys from `~/knowledge/.env.agents` into the repo.
- **Never push to any remote or touch `main` without Alex's explicit yes.**
  Commit locally on `founder-os`, small checkpoints, often.
- **Don't kill the dev server on 4100 or 4101** — other sessions use them.
  If your edit crashes the dev server's hot reload, fix it fast: a crash loop
  corrupts `.next` and breaks every session's page chunks (kill the port,
  `rm -rf .next`, restart).
- `/org` markup is frozen — do not restructure it.
- No em/en dashes in anything written for Alex.

## How to work

- TDD: failing test first (`tests/`, one file per module,
  `FOUNDER_OS_DB=:memory:`), then implement. `npm test` and
  `npm run typecheck` must be green before claiming done.
- Everything reads through the repo layer: `lib/db.ts` repos + `lib/schemas.ts`
  Zod validation + `lib/seed.ts` seeds. Never query SQLite from a page/route.
- Theme via CSS vars on `data-theme` (five themes in `app/globals.css`);
  Tailwind `os.*` tokens map to them. Keep `tailwind.config.ts` and
  `globals.css` in sync.
- Commands: `npm run dev` (port 4100) · `npm test` · `npm run typecheck` ·
  `npm run seed` · `npm run brain:docs`.

## Multi-agent etiquette

Multiple agent sessions (Claude, Codex) work this repo concurrently:
- `git log --oneline` to see where others are; commit small and often.
- Coordinate by surface: don't edit a page/component another session has
  uncommitted changes in (`git status` shows them).
- The Playwright browser is shared across sessions — expect interference.
- Leave handoff notes in `docs/` if you stop mid-feature.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
